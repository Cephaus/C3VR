VR apdaptation of my senior project C3

C3: A Poly-Modal Experience

This project is a hybrid media project that combines quad-copter time-based media with a Unity3D environment to comment and reflect on the relationship of natural and manmade environments from a unique perspective.

The music that is accompanying the performance is an original song to help carry and set a tone for what is being shown on screen.
My intention is to display another perspective that cannot be seen from the horizon but from an unreachable vantage point. The Unity3D scene builds the parallel from the virtual world and the natural world, following and evolving the progression of the song.

This is a recording of my live performance at the Digital Worlds Institute where I am control multiple parameters that are being displayed from all five projectors with a MIDI keyboard. This was my capstone project that I completed for my Bachelors of Arts in Digital Arts and Sciences at the University of Florida, Digitial Worlds Institute.

All the footage was shot on my DJI Phantom 3 Professional 
The song was created with the help from Kane Pour, Diana Salsa, and Trenton Ropp using Ableton.
The Unity3D scene was created utilizing multiple different open source assets created by Keijiro Takahashi and I also received some programing help from Nicholas Saunders.

I utilized multiple open source projects created by Keijiro Takahashi which can be found here at his repo:

Keijiro's projects are a great source for audio, shaders, and external device scripts for Unity.
